This is a quiz that is catered towards basic coding questions, the quiz is scored by how quickly you complete it, starting with 75 seconds on the clock, the penalty for a wrong answer is 10 seconds taken of the clock.
Then high scores are saved and able to access.



I started by building out the index.html file, or the 'home' page which is populated by a header containing a link to the 'high scores' page and also the countdown timer.

in the main body of the HTML file is the heading 'Coding Quiz Challenge' a short paragraph to explain the quiz and then the Start Button, which starts the quiz.


As you move your way through the quiz by clicking 'Start Quiz' you will notice the timer starting and you will be presented with the first question and set of answers. If you get the answer correct, you will hear the correct sound and it will move on to the next question.
If you get the question wrong, you will hear the wrong sound, and be penalized with a 10 second time deduction, which will then move you on to the next question.

Once you complete the quiz, you will be presented with your score, and have an input field where you are asked to put your initials and submit. Your score is then saved in the High Score HTML page, and you can choose to clear your high score list or go back.
